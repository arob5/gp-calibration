abstract = {The dynamic emulation of non-linear deterministic computer codes where the output is a time series, possibly multivariate, is examined. Such computer models simulate the evolution of some real-world phenomenon over time, for example models of the climate or the functioning of the human brain. The models we are interested in are highly non-linear and exhibit tipping points, bifurcations and chaotic behaviour. However, each simulation run could be too time-consuming to perform analyses that require many runs, including quantifying the variation in model output with respect to changes in the inputs. Therefore, Gaussian process emulators are used to approximate the output of the code. To do this, the flow map of the system under study is emulated over a short time period. Then, it is used in an iterative way to predict the whole time series. A number of ways are proposed to take into account the uncertainty of inputs to the emulators, after fixed initial conditions, and the correlation between them through the time series. The methodology is illustrated with two examples: the highly non-linear dynamical systems described by the Lorenz and van der Pol equations. In both cases, the predictive performance is relatively high and the measure of uncertainty provided by the method reflects the extent of predictability in each system.}

The run times of computer-intensive simulators are often such that it is impractical to make the thousands of model runs that are conventionally required for sensitivity analysis, uncertainty analysis or calibration. In response to this problem, highly efficient techniques have recently been developed based on a statistical meta-model (the emulator) that is built to approximate the computer model. The approach, however, is less straightforward for dynamic simulators, designed to represent time-evolving systems. Generalisations of the established methodology to allow for dynamic emulation are here proposed and contrasted.

abstract = {Many model-based investigation techniques, such as sensitivity analysis, optimization, and statistical inference, require a large number of model evaluations to be performed at different input and/or parameter values. This limits the application of these techniques to models that can be implemented in computationally efficient computer codes. Emulators, by providing efficient interpolation between outputs of deterministic simulation models, can considerably extend the field of applicability of such computationally demanding techniques. So far, the dominant techniques for developing emulators have been priors in the form of Gaussian stochastic processes (GASP) that were conditioned with a design data set of inputs and corresponding model outputs. In the context of dynamic models, this approach has two essential disadvantages: (i) these emulators do not consider our knowledge of the structure of the model, and (ii) they run into numerical difficulties if there are a large number of closely spaced input points as is often the case in the time dimension of dynamic models. To address both of these problems, a new concept of developing emulators for dynamic models is proposed. This concept is based on a prior that combines a simplified linear state space model of the temporal evolution of the dynamic model with Gaussian stochastic processes for the innovation terms as functions of model parameters and/or inputs. These innovation terms are intended to correct the error of the linear model at each output step. Conditioning this prior to the design data set is done by Kalman smoothing. This leads to an efficient emulator that, due to the consideration of our knowledge about dominant mechanisms built into the simulation model, can be expected to outperform purely statistical emulators at least in cases in which the design data set is small. The feasibility and potential difficulties of the proposed approach are demonstrated by the application to a simple hydrological model.}

    abstract = { We develop Bayesian dynamic linear model Gaussian processes for emulation of time series output for computer models that may exhibit chaotic behavior, but where this behavior retains some underlying structure. The statistical technology is particularly suited to emulating the time series output of large climate models that exhibit this feature and where we want samples from the posterior of the emulator to evolve in the same way as dynamic processes in the computer model do. The methodology combines key features of good uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods such as using complex mean functions to capture large-scale signals within parameter space, with dynamic linear models in a way that allows UQ to borrow strength from the Bayesian time series literature. We present an MCMC algorithm for sampling from the posterior of the emulator parameters when the roughness lengths of the Gaussian process are unknown. We discuss an interpretation of the results of this algorithm that allows us to use MCMC to fix the correlation lengths, making future online samples from the emulator tractable when used in practical applications where online MCMC is infeasible. We apply this methodology to emulate the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) as a time series output of the fully coupled non--flux-adjusted atmosphere-ocean general circulation model HadCM3. }

ABSTRACT = {We present an approach to enhance the performance and flexibility of the Bayesian inference of model parameters based on observations of the measured data. Going beyond the usual surrogate-enhanced Monte-Carlo or optimization methods that focus on a scalar loss, we place emphasis on a function-valued output of a formally infinite dimension. For this purpose, the surrogate models are built on a combination of linear dimensionality reduction in an adaptive basis of principal components and Gaussian process regression for the map between reduced feature spaces. Since the decoded surrogate provides the full model output rather than only the loss, it is re-usable for multiple calibration measurements as well as different loss metrics and, consequently, allows for flexible marginalization over such quantities and applications to Bayesian hierarchical models. We evaluate the method&rsquo;s performance based on a case study of a toy model and a simple riverine diatom model for the Elbe river. As input data, this model uses six tunable scalar parameters as well as silica concentrations in the upper reach of the river together with the continuous time-series of temperature, radiation, and river discharge over a specific year. The output consists of continuous time-series data that are calibrated against corresponding measurements from the Geesthacht Weir station at the Elbe river. For this study, only two scalar inputs were considered together with a function-valued output and compared to an existing model calibration using direct simulation runs without a surrogate.},

The originality of the method lies in an adaptation involving the representation of the likelihood function by a Gaussian process surrogate model, to cope with the high computational cost of the simulation, while avoiding the surrogate modeling of the functional output. The adaptation focuses on taking into account the uncertainty introduced by the use of a surrogate model when estimating the parameters posterior probability distribution by MCMC. To this end, trajectories of the random surrogate model of the likelihood function are drawn and injected in the MCMC algorithm. An application on a train suspension monitoring case is presented.}

abstract="The optimization of expensive-to-evaluate functions generally relies on metamodel-based exploration strategies. Many deterministic global optimization algorithms used in the field of computer experiments are based on Kriging (Gaussian process regression). Starting with a spatial predictor including a measure of uncertainty, they proceed by iteratively choosing the point maximizing a criterion which is a compromise between predicted performance and uncertainty. Distributing the evaluation of such numerically expensive objective functions on many processors is an appealing idea. Here we investigate a multi-points optimization criterion, the multipoints expected improvement ({\$}q-{\{}{\backslash}mathbb E{\}}I{\$}), aimed at choosing several points at the same time. An analytical expression of the {\$}q-{\{}{\backslash}mathbb E{\}}I{\$}is given when q{\thinspace}={\thinspace}2, and a consistent statistical estimate is given for the general case. We then propose two classes of heuristic strategies meant to approximately optimize the {\$}q-{\{}{\backslash}mathbb E{\}}I{\$}, and apply them to the classical Branin-Hoo test-case function. It is finally demonstrated within the covered example that the latter strategies perform as good as the best Latin Hypercubes and Uniform Designs ever found by simulation (2000 designs drawn at random for every q{\thinspace}∈ [1,10]).",

For example, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods typically require model runs and are sensitive to internal variability noise, rendering them infeasible for climate models. Here we demonstrate an approach to model calibration and uncertainty quantification that requires only model runs and can accommodate internal climate variability. The approach consists of three stages: (a) a calibration stage uses variants of ensemble Kalman inversion to calibrate a model by minimizing mismatches between model and data statistics; (b) an emulation stage emulates the parameter-to-data map with Gaussian processes (GP), using the model runs in the calibration stage for training; (c) a sampling stage approximates the Bayesian posterior distributions by sampling the GP emulator with MCMC. We demonstrate the feasibility and computational efficiency of this calibrate-emulate-sample (CES) approach in a perfect-model setting. Using an idealized general circulation model, we estimate parameters in a simple convection scheme from synthetic data generated with the model. The CES approach generates probability distributions of the parameters that are good approximations of the Bayesian posteriors, at a fraction of the computational cost usually required to obtain them. Sampling from this approximate posterior allows the generation of climate predictions with quantified parametric uncertainties.},

abstract = {Computer models simulating a physical process are used in many areas of science. Due to the complex nature of these codes it is often necessary to approximate the code, which is typically done using a Gaussian process. In many situations the number of code runs available to build the Gaussian process approximation is limited. When the initial design is small or the underlying response surface is complicated this can lead to poor approximations of the code output. In order to improve the fit of the model, sequential design strategies must be employed. In this paper we introduce two simple distance based metrics that can be used to augment an initial design in a batch sequential manner. In addition we propose a sequential updating strategy to an orthogonal array based Latin hypercube sample. We show via various real and simulated examples that the distance metrics and the extension of the orthogonal array based Latin hypercubes work well in practice.}

abstract = {Inferring arbitrary quantities of interest (QoI) using limited computational or, in realistic scenarios, financial budgets, is a challenging problem that requires sophisticated strategies for the optimal allocation of the available resources. Bayesian optimal experimental design identifies the optimal set of design locations for the purpose of solving a parameter inference problem and the optimality criterion is typically associated with maximizing the worth of information in the experimental measurements. Sequential design strategies further identify the optimal design in a sequential manner, starting from a initial budget and iteratively selecting new optimal points until either an accuracy threshold is reached, or a cost limit is exceeded. In this paper, we present a generic sequential Bayesian experimental design framework that relies on maximizing an information theoretic design criterion, namely the Expected Information Gain, in order to infer QoIs formed as nonlinear operators acting on black-box functions. Our framework relies on modeling the underlying response function using non-stationary Gaussian Processes, thus enabling efficient sampling from the QoI in order to provide Monte Carlo estimators for the design criterion. We demonstrate the performance of our method on an engineering problem of steel wire manufacturing and compare it with two classic approaches: uncertainty sampling and expected improvement.}
