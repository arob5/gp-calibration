% The Structure of Land Surface Models
\section{The Structure of Land Surface Models}
Unlike the typical PDE models used in atmospheric and oceanic modeling, the standard toolkit in land surface modeling 
consists primarily of ODEs describing time evolution at a single location. In this introductory section, we omit discussion 
of the application of these models across space, but return to this important topic in a later section. The notation 
used throughout this section can thus be thought of as suppressing a fixed spatial index on most of the quantities considered. 

While LSMs can incorporate a wide 
variety of terrestrial processes, we will focus on models of the carbon cycle when providing concrete examples. 
LSMs model the carbon cycle as consisting of a set of states (i.e., \textit{pools}; soil, roots, above-ground vegetation, atmosphere, etc.),
along with processes that transfer carbon between these states (i.e., \textit{fluxes}; photosynthesis, respiration, etc.). 
We denote the state vector at time $\Time$ by 
\begin{align}
\state(\Time) \Def [\indexState[1]{\state}(\Time), \dots, \indexState[\dimState]{\state}(\Time)]^\top \in \R^{\dimState}.
\end{align}
Carbon fluxes between these states are then described by an ODE model of the form 
\begin{align}
&\frac{d}{d\Time} \state_{\Par}(\Time) = \funcODE_{\Par}(\state_{\Par}(\Time), \forcing(\Time)), &&\state_{\Par}(\timeInit) = \stateInit, 
\end{align}
where $\funcODE_{\Par}(\cdot, \forcing): \R^{\dimState} \to \R^{\dimState}$ is typically a nonlinear function, and $\stateInit$ is the \textit{initial condition}, 
the value of the state at some initial time $\timeInit$. The forward dynamics encoded by $\funcODE_{\Par}$ are dependent both on a set of 
\textit{parameters} $\Par \in \parSpace \subset \R^{\dimPar}$, as well as a \textit{forcing} (or \textit{driving}) function $\forcing(\Time)$.
In general, the parameters $\Par$ are not physical constants; rather, they provide a means to empirically parameterize ecosystem 
processes, which may vary in space and time.   
We emphasize that the solution $\state_{\Par}(\Time)$ of the ODE is a function of the parameters $\Par$, driver $\forcing(\Time)$, and 
initial condition $\stateInit$, though only the first is made explicit in the notation as the parameters are the main quantity of interest in this document.

% The Forward Problem 
\subsection{The Forward Problem}
The \textit{forward problem} consists of recovering the solution $\state_{\Par}(\Time)$ over some time interval $[\timeInit, \timeEnd]$ for given 
values of $\Par$, $\stateInit$, and $\forcing(\cdot)$. Given the nonlinearity of $\funcODE_{\Par}$, this solution is typically approximated 
numerically at a finite set of times $\{\indexTime{\Time}\}_{\timeIdx=0}^{\lastTimeIdx} \subset [\timeInit, \timeEnd]$. We 
let $\stateApprox_{\Par}(\indexTime{\Time})$ denote the approximation of $\state_{\Par}(\indexTime{\Time})$ for each 
$\timeIdx = 0, \dots, \lastTimeIdx$. Also, let $\indexTime{\timeStep} \Def \indexTime[\timeIdx+1]{\Time} - \indexTime{\Time}$ denote the 
time step used by the numerical solver at the $\timeIdx^{\text{th}}$ iteration. Standard ODE solvers are time-stepping algorithms of the 
form 
\begin{align}
&\stateApprox_{\Par}(\indexTime[\timeIdx+1]{\Time}) \Def \fwdOne_{\Par}(\stateApprox_{\Par}(\indexTime{\Time}), \forcing(\indexTime{\Time}); \indexTime{\timeStep}), 
&&\stateApprox_{\Par}(\indexTime[0]{\Time}) = \stateInit, \label{ode_discrete}
\end{align}
for $\timeIdx = 1, \dots, \lastTimeIdx$. Setting a constant step size $\timeStep \equiv \indexTime{\timeStep}$ is a common choice, though 
algorithms that adapt the step size are also quite standard. In practice, the model drivers $\forcing(\indexTime{\Time})$
are typically given by a sequence of (noisy) observations of meteorological variables (e.g., photosynthetically-active radiation).
Going forward, we will treat the discrete dynamical system \ref{ode_discrete} as 
the true model and starting point for subsequent analysis, thus neglecting discretization error with respect to the true continuous-time solution. 

% The Inverse Problem
\subsection{The Inverse Problem}
As noted above, the forward solution of the ODE depends on the chosen value of the parameters $\Par$. In the LSM context, the values 
of these parameters are not known, and moreover, cannot always be observed directly. In other words, offline estimation of $\Par$
using a separate dataset is typically not possible for all of the parameters of interest. Historically, the choice of parameter settings 
was commonly performed on an ad hoc basis using expert judgement; simulating the models parameterized in this way is often 
referred to as performing ``free runs.'' 

Given that $\Par$ consists of empirical parameters 
(not physical constants) the concept of ``true'' parameter values is largely ill-defined. It is perhaps most conceptually useful to draw an 
analogy with empirically-determined parameters of a statistical model, in which ``true values'' implies best-fit in a regression sense.
