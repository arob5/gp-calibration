Scalable Bayesian Methods for Scientific Machine Learning

The effectiveness of formally combining scientific theory with statistical and machine learning methods is increasingly being recognized \cite{Willcox, Laubmeier, Wikle}. 
Physical models encapsulate prior scientific knowledge, while a rigorous statistical framework allows for principled inference, prediction, and uncertainty quantification \cite{Clark}. Computer models have become essential tools at this scientific-statistical interface, tackling problems from 
climate projections \cite{Canadell} to pandemic response \cite{Swallow}. The task of calibrating these models with noisy real-world data continues to present
significant challenges, requiring tradeoffs between realism and computational and statistical feasibility. Given the ubiquity of computer models in informing
 evidence-based policy, it is essential to develop methods to handle increased complexity while simultaneously providing a full accounting of uncertainties.
Recent calls have highlighted the need to bring together state-of-the-art computational methods with modern statistical 
and machine learning models in order to address these problems \cite{Wikle, Baker}. My proposed research aims to confront these challenges by developing novel methodological and computational approaches for integrating large-scale datasets with expensive computer models. 
% More generally, my research goal  is to improve scientifically-informed modeling of complex systems. 

Complex processes are commonly studied using a computer model $f$, where the output is a function of some unknown, unobserved parameter $\theta$.
For example, to study the terrestrial carbon cycle, ecologists use a process model $f$ 
that predicts the net exchange of carbon between an ecosystem and the atmosphere \cite{Friedlingstein, Waring}. Running the model requires specifying values for parameters that 
may not be known, such as the soil respiration rate or seasonal leaf growth \cite{Fer}. In order to estimate (i.e. calibrate) these unknown parameters, it is necessary to obtain observations $y$ 
of the underlying physical process in order to tune $\theta$ so that $f(\theta) \approx y$. This problem is typically formulated in a Bayesian statistical setting due to its flexibility in accommodating
various sources of uncertainty \cite{Kennedy, Clark}. For example, the simple yet common data model\begin{align*}
&y \sim N(f(\theta), \sigma^2 I) \\
&(\theta, \sigma^2) \sim \pi_0,
\end{align*}
assumes the simulator output gives the mean of the true process, subject to white noise. The prior distribution $\pi_0$ encodes domain knowledge about the 
process parameter $\theta$ and statistical parameter $\sigma^2$. The problem of inferring $\theta$ given the noisy observations $y$ and prior beliefs $\pi_0$ is referred to as a \textit{Bayesian inverse problem} \cite{Stuart}. Solving such a problem is defined 
 as obtaining the posterior distribution $p(\theta|y) \propto N(y|f(\theta), \sigma^2 I)\pi_0(\theta)$, which typically involves using an iterative inference procedure like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In practice, the runtime of the simulator $f$ may be prohibitively long, precluding the tens of thousands of evaluations typically required by MCMC. A standard approach to address this problem is to fit a Gaussian process 
emulator $\hat{f}(\cdot) \sim \mathcal{GP}(m(\cdot), k(\cdot, \cdot))$ to approximate $f$, which is then used in place of $f$ in the inference algorithm \cite{Kennedy, Fer, Cleary}. For example, this approximation is commonly used in terrestrial carbon modeling, given that sophisticated simulations of the carbon cycle can have a runtime of many hours \cite{Fer}. A second complication that arises in practice is the need to account for variation in model
parameters. In scientific applications, the underlying process commonly exhibits complex dynamics in space and time. The simplified statistical model above fails to account for these dynamics, preventing informed spatiotemporal decision making. Hierarchical statistical models can add spatial and temporal structure
to outputs $y$, process parameters $\theta$, and statistical parameters (e.g. $\sigma^2$), but further increase the computational burden of the inference procedure. 
%[finish sentence, maybe be more explicit that my proposal addresses the two issues detailed above]
 

 There remains significant work to be done in addressing these complications. While the use of Gaussian process emulators has become standard practice, little work has been done to study the proper way to incorporate the additional source of uncertainty introduced by this approximation [bad sentence]. Emulator uncertainty is often ignored or accounted for in an ad hoc manner, which can result in overly confident posterior estimates \cite{Cleary, Fer}. There remains a pressing need to comprehensively study the uncertainty implications of various approaches, and then to develop scalable algorithms that accurately propagate emulator uncertainty. Uncertainty quantification considerations are complicated further when spatiotemporal dynamics are included. There exists a recent body of literature that considers spatially or temporally indexed model outputs, typically through the use of basis function approximations \cite{Fadikar} or thrifty alternatives to full Bayesian inference \cite{Sun}. However, these approaches do not consider variation in process 
 parameters $\theta$ and typically sacrifice full uncertainty quantification to ease computational burdens. 
 
 Ad hoc solutions have been developed to deal with computer models with spatially or temporally indexed outputs \cite{Sun}, but these approaches rarely incorporate a
 explicit spatiotemporal model for the process parameters $\theta$ [cite]. Recent studies in the the terrestrial carbon modeling literature have 
 taken a step in this direction by allowing process parameters $\theta$ to exhibit Gaussian variability across different ecological data collection
sites \cite{Fer2}. This hierarchical structure was informative but fails to incorporate explicit spatial information such as a concept of ``nearness'' between the sites. 

\noindent
\textbf{Research Plan.} Uncertainty quantification is a major theme underlying each stage of this proposal, and is made more difficult
as increasingly complex statistical models require additional approximation techniques. Therefore, I will begin by addressing fundamental issues of uncertainty in the relatively simpler static, deterministic setting. Specifically, I will develop methods for incorporating emulator uncertainty into the statistical inference algorithm in order to achieve more ``honest'' uncertainty quantification. With this foundation established, I will then be in a position to integrate spatiotemporal dynamics into the statistical model, as well as consider the issue of stochastic simulators. These modeling steps will pose increasingly difficult computational challenges, which I intend to address via an interdisciplinary approach, drawing from spatiotemporal statistics, Bayesian inverse problem theory, and machine learning to develop novel dimensionality reduction and approximation methods. Throughout this process, I will test these methods on terrestrial carbon models commonly used in ecological forecasting \cite{Dietze, Canadell}. 
 
 \textbf{1. Propagating Emulator Uncertainty.} I will begin by exploring the ramifications of approximating the computationally expensive model $f$ with the  cheaper Gaussian process emulator $\hat{f}$. Naive emulation would simply use the Gaussian process mean $m(\theta)$ in place of the process model evaluation $f(\theta)$. Moreover, these existing methods consider only the Gaussian error model and treat emulator uncertainty in an independent fashion, failing to take advantage of the correlation in Gaussian process predictions. I will address these gaps in the literature by (i.) conducting a rigorous comparison of methods for propagating emulator uncertainty under the standard Gaussian noise model, (ii.) developing novel techniques which take advantage of the Gaussian process predictive correlation, and (iii.) generalize these methods to auto-regressive and Laplace error models, both of which 
are common in ecological applications \cite{Fer}. 

 \textbf{2. Spatio-temporal Dynamics.}
With methodologically sound and scalable algorithms in hand for the baseline static framework, I will then be in a position to begin investigating spatiotemporal generalizations of the statistical model. Given the spatiotemporal nature of most physical processes, this is an important extension that is often ignored, presumably due to computational challenges (\cite{Fer2}, [another citation]). Parameters $\theta$ may naturally be thought to vary over space
and time; even if they are believed to be static, a dynamic model allows for spatially and temporally varying uncertainty estimates, which can help identify 
missing processes in physical models, as well as provide a greater understanding of how models generalize beyond observed data \cite{Fer2, Dietze}. To address these issues I will extend the data model as 
  \[y(s, t) = f(\theta(s, t)) + \epsilon(s, t)\]
 where observed data $y$, process parameters $\theta$, and error $\epsilon$ are all modeled as spatiotemporal processes. Researchers in both the spatiotemporal statistics and computer modeling communities
have noted the potential for integrating methods in both fields using modern advances in machine learning and computation \cite{Wikle, Baker}. My proposed research will bridge this divide by (i.) developing novel techniques to integrate modern spatiotemporal dynamical models \cite{Wikle, Hefley}
within the computer modeling emulation framework, (ii.) develop dimensionality reduction and approximation methods that draw from Bayesian inverse problem 
theory \cite{Kugler} and Bayesian filtering \cite{Sarkka}, and (iii.) extend my previous uncertainty quantification methodology to this more complex setting.
