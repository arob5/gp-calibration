This document demonstrates how to apply methods based in Ensemble Kalman 
methodology to produce samples from an approximate posterior distribution 
to a Bayesian inverse problem. It is intended as a tutorial for using the 
functions implemented in `ens_Kalman_inversion.r`. We will refer to these 
methods as Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) algorithms.

# Example Inverse Problem
We load a pre-defined Bayesian inverse problem based on the Very Simple 
Ecosystem Model (VSEM) toy model. Convenience functions that provide access to 
fully specified Bayesian inverse problems can be found in 
`inv_prob_test_functions.r`. The inverse problem is defined via the components 
of the list returned by these functions in a standardized format.

```{r}
# Example inverse problem based on calibrating parameters of the 
# VSEM vegetation model.
inv_prob <- get_vsem_test_1_time_avg()

# Exact likelihood (no emulation).
llik_exact <- inv_prob$llik_obj

# Prior distribution.
par_prior <- inv_prob$par_prior

# Noise variance parameter (assumed fixed here).
sig2 <- inv_prob$sig2_model
```


## Prior distribution
```{r}
print(inv_prob$par_info)
prior_plots <- plot_prior_samp(par_prior)
for(plt in prior_plots) plot(plt)
```

## Data and Prior Predictive Distribution
TODO: Add in your plots showing the observations and some of the forward model runs
(e.g., the plot with the horizontal lines).

## Exact posterior samples
We will compare the EKI posterior approximations to the baseline of exact 
MCMC sampling. The exact MCMC samples are obtained below.
```{r}
n_mcmc <- 25000L
mcmc_list <- mcmc_bt_wrapper(llik_exact, par_prior, n_itr=n_mcmc, sampler="DEzs")
samp_dt <- format_mcmc_output(mcmc_list$samp, test_label="mcmc") 
```

```{r}
burn_in_start <- 12500L
trace_plots <- get_trace_plots(samp_dt, itr_start=burn_in_start)
for(plt in trace_plots) plot(plt)
```

# Ensemble Kalman Inversion
The main entry point for running EKI is the function `run_eki()`. We demonstrate
the various options supported by this function below. We start by defining 
various quantities that will be passed to this function, including the data 
vector and parameter-to-observable map. We synonymously refer to the latter as
the "forward model" for the sake of brevity. We also generate the initial ensemble  
and corresponding forward model outputs; this is not strictly necessary since the 
`run_eki()` function will initialize ensemble if it is not explicitly passed.
We do so here so we can pass the same initial ensemble to the function when 
experimenting with different settings.

```{r}
# Data vector, likelihood covariance, and forward model.
y <- drop(inv_prob$y)
p <- inv_prob$dim_obs
d <- inv_prob$dim_par
Sig <- diag(inv_prob$sig2_model, nrow=p)
fwd <- inv_prob$par_to_obs_op

# Initial ensembles (parameters and model outputs).
n_ens <- 200L
U <- get_batch_design(method="LHS", N_batch=n_ens, prior_params=par_prior)
G <- fwd(U)
```

## Single Iteration, Default Parameter Transformations
We start by running `run_eki()` with its default settings. The default 
behavior is to run a single iteration of EKI, which implies one round of 
forward model runs. Since we are passing in the initial runs explicitly, the 
below call will not require any additional forward model runs. The default 
settings will also create a default transport map by calling 
`get_default_par_map()`. The point of the transport map is to transform the 
parameter ensemble to something that plays more nicely with the Gaussian 
approximations underlying EKI. The default map transforms each parameter 
independently to a Gaussian via inverse transform sampling. This default 
can be overwritten by explicitly passing a map via the `par_map` argument.

```{r}
# Run single step of EKI.
eki_output <- run_eki(y, fwd, Sig, par_prior=par_prior, U0=U, G0=G) 
U_new <- eki_output$U
eki_list <- eki_output$eki_list
```

```{r}
# Append EKI approximate posterior samples to samples data.table.
samp_dt <- append_samples_mat(samp_dt, U_new, param_type="par",  
                              test_label="eki", chain_idx=1L)

# Also append the prior ensemble for comparison.
samp_dt <- append_samples_mat(samp_dt, U, param_type="par", test_label="prior")
```


### 1d Marginal Posterior Approximations
```{r}
kde_plts <- get_1d_kde_plots(samp_dt, test_label_baseline="mcmc")
for(plt in kde_plts) plot(plt)
```

### EKI Posterior Predictive Distribution
TODO: below is an example for the kind of plot that would be useful, but it 
needs updating. In general, this style of plot nicely shows that the EnKF update 
tends to make the model runs concentrate around the observed data. 
The `plot_curves_1d_helper()` needs updating so I would 
probably write a new function to produce these plots instead of using this 
helper function (for now). Some thoughts on this kind of plot:
1. The line colors are currently not telling us anything, so I would either make 
them all the same neutral color (e.g., gray). Or you could try coloring them by 
a color gradient which is given by the true posterior density.
2. 
```{r}
obs_idx <- seq_along(y)
G_new <- fwd(U_new)

prior_pred <- plot_curves_1d_helper(obs_idx, t(G), plot_title="Prior", 
                                    legend=FALSE, y_new=y, xlab="month")
eki_post_pred <- plot_curves_1d_helper(obs_idx, t(G_new), plot_title="EKI single step", 
                                       legend=FALSE, y_new=y, xlab="month")

plot(prior_pred)
plot(eki_post_pred)
```

TODO: continue as above by including all of the kind of plots you've been 
working on, such as the 2d marginal density plots, the pairs plots, etc. For the 
pairs plots, show the differences between the transformed and untransformed 
ensembles.

## EKI with Multiple Steps
We now consider generalizations whereby the EnKF update is applied a finite 
number of times using a tempered likelihood. 

TODO: demonstrate how to execute `run_eki()` with multiple iterations. Compare 
the final posterior approximation produced as total number of iterations 
varies (like the plots you've already showed me). Also demonstrate how the
ensemble evolves within a single run (over iterations within a single run).
