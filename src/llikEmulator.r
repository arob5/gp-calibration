# llikEmulator: Class encapsulating a (typically stochastic) approximation to 
#               the log-likelihood. 
# 
# This is the base class for a log likelihood approximation. It is intentionally 
# quite general and intended to be the parent class for more specialized 
# log likelihood approximation classes (e.g. multiplicative Gaussian llik 
# with sum of squares emulated by GPs). This class is primarily intended 
# to encapsulate a stochastic approximation to the log-likelihood, but 
# it can be set up to function with a deterministic approximation (or 
# just the exact likelihood, which is useful for testing code). Given the 
# generality, not all of the core methods may apply to all approximate 
# likelihoods. For example, the `mean_lik()` method is intended to return 
# the expectation of the likelihood (i.e. the expectation of the 
# exponentiated log-likelihood). In certain cases, there may not be a closed
# form for this expression and the user may just implement this method 
# to return an error if it is called. Alternatively, the user may want to 
# implement this function to return a numerical approximation of this 
# quantity. The field `model` is intended to be a model object of some 
# sort (e.g. a gpWrapper instance) which is used to define the llik 
# approximation. `lik_par` is stores the likelihood parameters. These 
# can be stored in advance if the likelihood parameters will be fixed
# throughout an analysis; otherwise, this field can be left NULL. Note 
# that the likelihood approximation may be a function of the likelihood 
# parameters (e.g. the likelihood parameters are included as inputs to 
# a GP emulator). 
#
# This class organizes the pieces comprising the likelihood into 
# (1) "inputs": the primary parameters of interest; e.g. the parameters 
# characterizing the forward model in an inverse problem; (2) "lik_par", 
# other likelihood parameters (e.g. variance parameters) that define 
# the observation model, may be unknown, but are not of primary interest; 
# and (3) "lik_components", which are fixed quantities such as a 
# sample size. 
# 
# Implementing a deterministic approximation: 
# There are different ways to approach this. One is to just have the 
# methods `mean_log()`, `mean_lik()`, `sample()` all return the 
# determistic approximation. It may make sense to implement 
# `var_log()` and `var_lik()` to return 0 or throw an error, depending 
# on the specific needs. Note that this same method could be used 
# to implement the exact (not approximate) likelihood as well, which 
# could then be used for testing purposes. 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#
# TODO: update this so that it is defined by default to be a CONDITIONAL likelihood, 
# viewed as a function of `input` with `lik_par` being the other parameters being 
# conditioned on, and `lik_component` being other fixed stuctural information (such 
# as sample size, number of outputs, etc.). Thus, by default all functions should 
# output unnormalized values, dropping terms that only depend on `lik_par`. Overriding 
# the default would then include these terms. An alternative is to have a class 
# attribute that stores the default behavior.

# llikEmulatorMultGausGP: Encapsulates an approximation of a multiplicative 
# Gaussian likelihood where the "sum of squared error" functions have been 
# approximated by independent GPs. In particular, considers log-likelihood 
# of the form: 
#   log p(Y|u, Sig) = C - 0.5 * sum_{p=1}^{P} sum_{t=1}^{T_p} (Y_{tp} - G(u)_{tp})^2 / sig2_p
# where C is a constant and G a function. The mappings 
#   Phi(u) := sum_{t=1}^{T_p} (Y_{tp} - G(u)_{tp})^2
# are assumed to be emulated by independent GPs. Hence the `model` field of this 
# class is required to inherit from the `gpWrapper` class. This class interprets
# the `input` argument as `u` (typically the forward model parameters, which 
# are of primary interest). This class also requires a second argument `sig2` to its 
# core functions, which is the vector of variance parameters. 
#
# By default, the class represents a "conditional" llik (meaning conditional 
# on some current value of `sig2`), which practically means that setting 
# `normalize=FALSE` will drop additive constants that depend on `sig2`. 
# By setting `default_conditional=FALSE`, this behavior is reversed and 
# terms involving `sig2` are no longer interpreted as normalizing constants.
